## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
mqtt_host: "192.168.1.10"
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_user: "ha"
mqtt_password: "supersecure"
mqtt_topic: "pdu"
log_level: "INFO"
auto_discovery: false
discovery_network: "192.168.1"
pdu_list:
  - name: rack_01
    host: "192.168.1.112"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
```

### Auto-Discovery Configuration
```yaml
mqtt_host: "192.168.1.10"
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_user: "ha"
mqtt_password: "supersecure"
mqtt_topic: "pdu"
auto_discovery: true
discovery_network: "192.168.1"
pdu_list: []  # Empty - PDUs will be auto-discovered
```

### Multiple PDUs Configuration
```yaml
mqtt_host: "192.168.1.10"
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_user: "ha"
mqtt_password: "supersecure"
mqtt_topic: "pdu"
auto_discovery: false
discovery_network: "192.168.1"
pdu_list:
  - name: rack_01
    host: "192.168.1.112"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
  - name: rack_02
    host: "192.168.1.113"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
  - name: server_room
    host: "192.168.1.114"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
```

## 🔍 Auto-Discovery

The add-on can automatically discover PDUs on your network:

1. **Enable auto-discovery** in the configuration
2. **Set the network prefix** (e.g., "192.168.1")
3. **The add-on will scan** for PDUs and test common credentials
4. **Discovered PDUs** will be automatically configured

### Manual Discovery
You can also run the discovery script manually:

```bash
# From the add-on directory
python discover_pdus.py 192.168.1
```

This will:
- Scan the network for PDUs
- Test common credentials (admin/admin, admin/password, etc.)
- Generate a configuration file
- Show you the discovered PDUs

## 📡 MQTT Topics

| Topic                                | Type        | Description               |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `pdu/rack_01/outlet1` to `outlet8`   | State       | Current outlet state      |
| `pdu/rack_01/outletX/set`            | Command     | Send "on" or "off"        |
| `pdu/rack_01/temperature`            | Sensor      | Temperature (°C)          |
| `pdu/rack_01/humidity`               | Sensor      | Humidity (%)              |
| `pdu/rack_01/current`                | Sensor      | Current usage (A)         |

## 🧩 Integration in Home Assistant (example)

```yaml
mqtt:
  switch:
    - name: "Rack 01 - Outlet 1"
      state_topic: "pdu/rack_01/outlet1"
      command_topic: "pdu/rack_01/outlet1/set"
      payload_on: "on"
      payload_off: "off"
      retain: true

  sensor:
    - name: "Rack 01 - Temperature"
      state_topic: "pdu/rack_01/temperature"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Add-on won't start**
   - Check MQTT broker connectivity
   - Verify PDU IP addresses are reachable
   - Check logs in Home Assistant → Settings → Add-ons → LogiLink & Intellinet PDU MQTT Bridge (BETA) → Logs

2. **No data from PDU**
   - Test PDU connectivity manually:
     ```bash
     curl -u admin:admin http://YOUR_PDU_IP/status.xml
     ```
   - Verify PDU credentials are correct
   - Check if PDU is accessible from Home Assistant network

3. **MQTT topics not appearing**
   - Verify MQTT broker is running
   - Check MQTT credentials
   - Use MQTT Explorer to monitor topics

4. **Auto-discovery not working**
   - Check if PDUs are on the specified network
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check logs for discovery errors

### Testing PDU Connection

You can test PDU connectivity using the included test script:

```bash
# From the add-on directory
python test_pdu.py 192.168.1.112 admin admin
```

### Log Level

The `log_level` option accepts three values:

| Value | Messages shown |
| --- | --- |
| `WARNING` | Unexpected or degraded conditions, plus errors and critical failures |
| `INFO` | Normal startup, connections, discovery and control actions, plus warnings/errors |
| `DEBUG` | Detailed polling, MQTT subscriptions, HTTP access and diagnostic data, plus all higher levels |

The default is `INFO`. To enable diagnostic logging:

```yaml
log_level: DEBUG
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Test PDU HTTP access:**
   ```bash
   curl -u admin:admin http://YOUR_PDU_IP/status.xml
   ```

2. **Test MQTT connectivity:**
   ```bash
   mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_MQTT_HOST -u YOUR_USER -P YOUR_PASS -t "pdu/test" -m "test"
   ```

3. **Run discovery manually:**
   ```bash
   python discover_pdus.py YOUR_NETWORK_PREFIX
   ```
