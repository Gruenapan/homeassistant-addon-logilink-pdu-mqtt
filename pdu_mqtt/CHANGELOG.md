## Migration Guide

### From 1.3.x to 1.4.0

1. **Configuration Update**: Replace `pdu_list` with `device_list` in your configuration
2. **Device Types**: Add `type: "PDU"` to existing PDU entries
3. **New Features**: Explore the enhanced web interface for device discovery
4. **Shelly Integration**: Add Shelly devices to your configuration using the discovery interface

### Example Migration

**Before (1.3.x)**:
```yaml
pdu_list:
  - name: "rack_pdu"
    host: "192.168.1.100"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
```

**After (1.4.0)**:
```yaml
device_list:
  - name: "rack_pdu"
    host: "192.168.1.100"
    type: "PDU"
    username: "admin"
    password: "admin"
```

## Future Roadmap

- **Additional Device Types**: Support for more smart home devices
- **Enhanced UI**: More visualization options and control panels
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Built-in scheduling for device control
